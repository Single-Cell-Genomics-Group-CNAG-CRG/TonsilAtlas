This folder contains the scripts and information necessary to upload all fastq files to ArrayExpress.

Noteworthy, all the information to accomplish that is contained in this repository, which allows us to
keep track of every file and easily link it to its corresponding metadata.

We draw inspiration from the [naming scheme of TCGA](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/TCGA_Barcode/) to rename
all fastqs before uploading them to ArrayExpress.
