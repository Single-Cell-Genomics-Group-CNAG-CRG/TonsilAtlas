### Sample description ###
Human tonsil Visium samples from the BCLLATLAS project subproject BCLLATLAS_32.
4 Tonsils were sequenced: 55413, 57017, 57976, T1.19 in flowcell HJWCVDRXX.
These tonsils correspond to 3 kids and 1 adult in order.

### Metadata available ###
- Metadata for these samples can be found in the img folder.
Protocol permeabilizatoin optimization results are in OPTIMIZATION_Tonsil_Pamplona_04-06-20.pptx. Optimal permeabilization was at 6min
- Original sample region of each slide can be seen in ST_tonsils.pptx

### Sequencing protocol ###
The sequencing protocol followed current visium best practices and sequencing cycles were 120 = 28+10+10+82;
28bp - spatial barcode + UMI.
10bp + 10bp - dual identifier i5 and i7.
82bp for the read, no decrease in performance is observed.
These samples were sequenced in a Visium slide wiht PN: V19S23-039
